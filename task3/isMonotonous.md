Given array of integers, check if it represents either a strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing sequence.

Example

For sequence = [1, 4, 5, 7, 9], the output should be
isMonotonous(sequence) = true;
For sequence = [0], the output should be
isMonotonous(sequence) = true;
For sequence = [3, 3], the output should be
isMonotonous(sequence) = false.
